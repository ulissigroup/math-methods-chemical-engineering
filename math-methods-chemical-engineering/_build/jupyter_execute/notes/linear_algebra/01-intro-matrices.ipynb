    "\n",
    "* The purpose of this course is to learn how to formulate and solve chemical engineering problems using analytical and numerical math methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is both a math course and an engineering course. I will teach you mathematical tools to solve real world problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The best chemical engineers are often the ones that are best at math. Math is a powerful tool and chemical engineers are jacks of many trades that requires a hefty toolbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Being good at math is not some talent that you were born with. Every one of you has the opportunity to be good at math this semester and for the rest of your life. All you need to do is practice. A lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There will be many demands on your time this semester. Lab 1, Fluids, electives, extracurriculars. We ask a lot of you because we know you can do it! Working hard in this class is an investment that will help you with the rest of your classes. "
