    "* The purpose of this course is to learn how to formulate and solve chemical engineering problems using analytical and numerical math methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is both a math course and an engineering course. I will teach you mathematical tools to solve real world problems.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* There will be many demands on your time this semester. Lab 1, Fluids, electives, extracurriculars. We ask a lot of you because we know you can do it! Working hard in this class is an investment that will help you with the rest of your classes. "
